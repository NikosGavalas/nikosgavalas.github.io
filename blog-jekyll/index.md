subtitle: Software, Systems, Networks.

Analytical, highly-motivated, conscientious, results-driven software engineer, with a passion about finding 
optimal solutions to various problems. Always excited about learning and applying new technologies. Excellent 
written and verbal communication skills.

I am mainly interested in distributed systems, orchestrating many computing platforms to effectively and efficiently handle 
big amounts of data and extract beneficial information. 

Other interests include embedded systems, operating systems, and artificial neural networks.

Besides software, I also enjoy physics, astrophotography, drumming, and travelling.

_By the way, the site you are viewing is hosted on my personal home server (a mighty Raspberry Pi 3), together with my git/CI server (on an even mightier ROCK64 SBC). Hope you like it ;)_
