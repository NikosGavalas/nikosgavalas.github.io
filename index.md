Analytical, conscientious, results-driven software engineer, with a passion about finding optimal solutions to various problems. Always excited about learning and applying new technologies.

<!-- During my studies at NTUA, which consisted of a 5 year program of 62 courses and a thesis, I have designed digital logic components in Verilog, soldered analog circuits, performed signal processing in MATLAB, programmed ARM processors and AVR microcontrollers in Assembly, compared cache settings of CPUs, simulated entire network topologies, switches, routers, VPNs, DMZs, studied network protocols from physical to application layer, created character device drivers for the Linux Kernel, implemented countless algorithms and analyzed their performance and complexity, solved numerous algorithmic challenges, worked in a team to build a production-ready web application, studied database engines, distributed systems, embedded systems, theoretical computer science, modern cryptographic protocols, biomedical engineering, and during writing my thesis I also studied machine learning algorithms and deployed some of the most known big data platforms in the industry for processing streams of data at a big scaleâ€¦yeah it was a big journey, and an exciting one. -->

<!-- Besides university, I have gained a lot of experience working as a developer at two startups, as well as a freelance web developer and IT infrastructure manager. I aspire to work as a software engineer at a big software company after I graduate in a few months. -->

With a deep understanding of computer systems, from transistors to web applications, experience in the latest technology, and knowledge of the best practices in software engineering, my goal as a professional - and enthusiastic hobbyist - is to design and implement the most efficient solution to every problem and automate everything that can be automated.

In addition to programming, I also enjoy astronomy and drumming.
