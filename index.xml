      <title>SSH: How to prevent MITM attacks</title>

      <description>Consider the following scenario: You connect to some remote machine for the first time via SSH, and you get the following message:
nick@sapphire: $ ssh &amp;lt;host&amp;gt; The authenticity of host &#39;&amp;lt;host&amp;gt;&#39; can&#39;t be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:I9Uxj/t8o1tSpfnA/II1BJqvMw8eELmLhRQAylPL7Lk. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  The SSH client gives you the SHA256 hash of the remote host&amp;rsquo;s public key (its fingerprint) and asks you to verify that the host you are attempting to connect to is indeed the one you want to connect to.</description>

      <title>Solving the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem</title>

      <description>The 0-1 Knapsack problem is a popular combinatorial optimization problem:
 Given a set of n items, each having a value \( p_i \) and a weight of \( w_i \), find a subset of these items such that the total value is maximized, while keeping the total weight of the items under a given constant weight capacity W.
 Formally, we need to maximize \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_{i}f_{i}} \), while subjecting to \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_{i}f_{i}} \le W \), \( f_i \in \{0, 1\}, \forall i \in \{ 1, &amp;hellip;, n\} \).</description>

      <title>Ansible hostvars JSON querying with JMESPath</title>

      <description>I was writing an ansible playbook to deploy an Apache Flink cluster, and I ran into this problem while editing the configuration files:
 How can I get the total number of the vCPUs of all the &amp;ldquo;slave&amp;rdquo; machines running on the cluster?
 I thought of the hostvars ansible variable, which stores the gathered facts about the hosts, so using the debug module, I printed it out. The result was a JSON like that:</description>

      <title>Building networks with FreeBSD (Part 2)</title>

      <description>Welcome to the second part of my tutorial series. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to use the Quagga Software Suite for dynamic routing.
The dynamic routing protocols we &amp;rsquo;ll use are the most widely used today: RIP, OSPF and BGP.
For some details on what these protocols are used for, and how they work, you can take a look at this post.
At the end of the post you will find details for the IPv6 versions of these protocols.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my tutorial series for using the FreeBSD OS and the Quagga software routing suite for building network architectures.
I hope this series serves a good reference point for anyone interested in examining and getting hands-on experience with the routing protocols and network topologies. However I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into the details on how the protocols work.
To emulate the needed hardware for testing purposes, I &amp;rsquo;m using VirtualBox, and I recommend it.</description>

      <description>I wrote this little article when I was learning about Docker, to use it for self reference. But then I thought that other beginners may find it useful too, so why not post it on my blog?
So let&amp;rsquo;s get right into it.
What is Docker? If you already have an idea about what docker is, and why it&amp;rsquo;s userful, skip this part.
Docker is a platform that allows you to run your applications in an isolated environment.</description>

      <description>I graduated from the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens.
My interests include but are not limited to Big Data technologies, DevOps, Embedded Systems, Algorithms&amp;hellip; really anything related to programming, systems, maths.
I also enjoy drumming and astrophotography.
I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to talk about all these, contact links are below.
