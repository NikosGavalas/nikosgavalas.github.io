      <description>Consider the following scenario: You connect to some remote machine for the first time via SSH, and you get the following message:
nick@sapphire: $ ssh &amp;lt;host&amp;gt; The authenticity of host &#39;&amp;lt;host&amp;gt;&#39; can&#39;t be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:I9Uxj/t8o1tSpfnA/II1BJqvMw8eELmLhRQAylPL7Lk. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  The SSH client gives you the SHA256 hash of the remote host&amp;rsquo;s public key (its fingerprint) and asks you to verify that the host you are attempting to connect to is indeed the one you want to connect to.</description>

      <description>I was writing an ansible playbook to deploy an Apache Flink cluster, and I ran into this problem while editing the configuration files:
 How can I get the total number of the vCPUs of all the &amp;ldquo;slave&amp;rdquo; machines running on the cluster?
 I thought of the hostvars ansible variable, which stores the gathered facts about the hosts, so using the debug module, I printed it out. The result was a JSON like that:</description>

      <description>I wrote this little article when I was learning about Docker, to use it for self reference. But then I thought that other beginners may find it useful too, so why not post it on my blog?
So let&amp;rsquo;s get right into it.
What is Docker? If you already have an idea about what docker is, and why it&amp;rsquo;s userful, skip this part.
Docker is a platform that allows you to run your applications in an isolated environment.</description>
