      <description>During the writing of my master thesis, I studied thoroughly Anomaly Detection algorithms with a focus on those of them that could be deployed not only on batches, but on streams of data, in order to achieve real-time Anomaly Detection, on a big scale.
After research, I chose 5 algorithms with such capabilities that looked promising, studied the relevant papers and understood how they worked. I then proceeded to implement each one, run it on a cluster (with the help of Apache Flink) with real and synthetic datasets, and find out the strenghts and weaknesses of each.</description>

      <description>The 0-1 Knapsack problem is a popular combinatorial optimization problem:
 Given a set of n items, each having a value \( p_i \) and a weight of \( w_i \), find a subset of these items such that the total value is maximized, while keeping the total weight of the items under a given constant weight capacity W.
 Formally, we need to maximize \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_{i}f_{i}} \), while subjecting to \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_{i}f_{i}} \le W \), \( f_i \in \{0, 1\}, \forall i \in \{ 1, &amp;hellip;, n\} \).</description>
