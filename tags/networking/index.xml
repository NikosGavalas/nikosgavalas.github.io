      <description>Welcome to the second part of my tutorial series. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to use the Quagga Software Suite for dynamic routing.
The dynamic routing protocols we &amp;rsquo;ll use are the most widely used today: RIP, OSPF and BGP.
For some details on what these protocols are used for, and how they work, you can take a look at this post.
At the end of the post you will find details for the IPv6 versions of these protocols.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my tutorial series for using the FreeBSD OS and the Quagga software routing suite for building network architectures.
I hope this series serves a good reference point for anyone interested in examining and getting hands-on experience with the routing protocols and network topologies. However I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into the details on how the protocols work.
To emulate the needed hardware for testing purposes, I &amp;rsquo;m using VirtualBox, and I recommend it.</description>
