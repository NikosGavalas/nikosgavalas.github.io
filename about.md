I graduated from the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens.

My interests include but are not limited to Big Data technologies, DevOps, Embedded Systems, Algorithms... really
anything related to programming and mathematics.

I also enjoy drumming and astrophotography.
